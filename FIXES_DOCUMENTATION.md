# Image Recognition: Deleted Items Fix

## Problem Identified
When querying the database for image matches, the backend was returning matches for items that have already been deleted.

## Root Cause
The FAISS index used for similarity search was built once at application startup and never updated when items were deleted. This caused a sync issue between:
- ✅ Database (properly updated)  
- ✅ S3 Storage (properly updated)
- ❌ FAISS Search Index (stale data)

## Solution Implemented

### Primary Fix: Rebuild FAISS Index After Changes
Added a `rebuild_faiss_index()` function that recreates the global FAISS index from the current database state. This function is called after:
- ✅ Item deletion (`/item/{item_id}`)
- ✅ Image deletion (`/item_image/{item_id}/{filename}`)  
- ✅ New image upload (`/upload/`)

### Code Changes Made
1. **Added rebuild function** in `backend/src/app.py`:
   ```python
   def rebuild_faiss_index():
       """Rebuild the global FAISS index after database changes"""
       global faiss_index, faiss_images, faiss_vectors
       faiss_index, faiss_images, faiss_vectors = build_faiss_index()
   ```

2. **Updated deletion endpoints** to call `rebuild_faiss_index()` instead of the unused `update_features()`

3. **Updated upload endpoint** to rebuild index after new images are added

## Performance Considerations

### Current Solution (Good for Small-Medium Datasets)
- Rebuilds entire FAISS index on every change
- Simple and reliable
- Good for datasets with < 10,000 images

### Future Optimization (For Large Datasets)
If you have many images and performance becomes an issue, consider:

1. **Lazy Index Rebuild**: Only rebuild when queried, with a dirty flag
2. **Incremental Updates**: Track changes and rebuild periodically (e.g., every N operations or every X minutes)
3. **Advanced FAISS Operations**: Use FAISS's remove_ids() functionality (requires IndexIDMap wrapper)

## Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Database-First Query**: Skip FAISS entirely, store vectors in DB, use PostgreSQL's vector extensions (pgvector)
2. **Message Queue**: Use Redis/RabbitMQ to queue index rebuilds
3. **Microservice Architecture**: Separate search service that can be updated independently

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix works:

1. Upload some images for items
2. Query to confirm they appear in search results  
3. Delete an item via the API
4. Query again - deleted items should no longer appear
5. Check that remaining items still work correctly

## Deployment Notes

- No database schema changes required
- No S3 changes required  
- Restart the backend service to apply the changes
- Existing data will work correctly after restart
