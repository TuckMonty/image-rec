 - resolve the OpenMP issue. Here's what we did as a temp fix: 
 This error is caused by conflicting OpenMP runtime libraries (often from different Python packages like PyTorch and FAISS).
To work around it for testing, set the environment variable KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE before starting your server.
This will allow the server to run despite the conflict.
For a permanent fix, you may need to align package versions or use a different vector search library, but this workaround is safe for prototyping.

- I think the query function is referencing items that no have already been deleted
